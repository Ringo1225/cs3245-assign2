1. In this assignment, we didn't ask you to support phrasal queries, which is a
feature that is typically supported in web search engines. Describe how you would
support phrasal search in conjunction with the VSM model. A sketch of the algorithm
is sufficient.


Answer.



2. Describe how your search engine reacts to long documents and long queries as compared
to short documents and queries. Is the normalization you use sufficient to address the
problems (see Section 6.4.4 for a hint)? In your judgement, is the Itc.Inc scheme (n.b.,
not the ranking scheme you were asked to implement) sufficient for retrieving documents
from the Reuters-21578 collection?


Answer.



3. Do you think zone or field parametric indices would be useful for practical search
in the Reuters collection? Note: the Reuters collection does have metadata for each
article but the quality of the metadata is not uniform, nor are the metadata
classifications uniformly applied (some documents have it, some don't).
